# Making a scatterplot

## Load ggplot2

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

## Scatterplot

``` r
weather_plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Temperature vs Time_hour in Early January", 
       x = "Time_hour",
       y = "Temperature",
       color = "Humidity")
weather_plot
```
