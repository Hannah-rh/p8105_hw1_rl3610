# Problem 1

## Load the Library and Dataset

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
data("early_january_weather")
```

## Describing the Dataset

### early_january_weather

The variables included in this dataset are: origin, year, month, day,
hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
pressure, visib, time_hour. Some important variables are temp, humid,
and time_hour, which will be used to create a scatterplot in the next
step.

This dataset contains 358 rows and 15 columns.

The mean temperature for the dataset is 39.5821229.

## Making a scatterplot

### Load ggplot2

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

### Scatterplot

``` r
weather_plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Temperature vs Time_hour in Early January", 
       x = "Time_hour",
       y = "Temperature",
       color = "Humidity")
weather_plot
```

### Saving the Plot

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.png", plot = weather_plot, width = 8, height = 6)
```

# Problem 2

## Create a Data Frame

### Four Factors

**1. a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution**

``` r
random_sample = rnorm(10)
```

**2. a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
greater than 0**

``` r
logical_vector = ifelse(random_sample > 0, "yes", "no")
```

**3. a character vector of length 10**

``` r
character_vector = c("cat","dog","bird","fish","ant","bee","cow","duck","lion","tiger")
```

**4. a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”**

``` r
factor_vector = factor(c("A","B","C","A","B","C","A","B","C","A"))
```

### Data Frame

``` r
my_dataframe = data.frame(
  random = random_sample,
  logical = logical_vector,
  character = character_vector,
  factor = factor_vector
)
my_dataframe #print the data frame
```

    ##        random logical character factor
    ## 1   0.1757724     yes       cat      A
    ## 2   0.4226179     yes       dog      B
    ## 3  -0.6350864      no      bird      C
    ## 4  -0.2322839      no      fish      A
    ## 5  -0.9688989      no       ant      B
    ## 6   1.6163936     yes       bee      C
    ## 7   0.5820116     yes       cow      A
    ## 8  -0.1469449      no      duck      B
    ## 9   0.8839267     yes      lion      C
    ## 10  0.0785609     yes     tiger      A
